## Key Information 

The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether or not to be a part of this study. More detailed information is listed later on in this form.

### Why am I being invited to take part in a research study?

You are being invited to take part in a research study because you are a student in the course CSE 199/CSE331/CSE442/CSE 474 at the University at Buffalo.

### What should I know about a research study?

*	Someone will explain this research study to you.

*	You cannot reach the research team.
*	You want to talk to someone besides the research team.
*	You want to get information or provide input about this research.

### How many people will be studied?

We expect about 500 people here will be in this research study.

### What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?

You will be asked to fill in an online survey by the middle of the semester. The survey will ask questions related to your thoughts on ethics as it pertains to your discipline. We expect the survey to take 20 minutes (on average) and not more than 30 minutes to complete.

### What happens to the information collected for the research?

Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study and medical or education records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of this organization. 

We will collect some personal information (your person number and UBIT name). The researchers involved in the project will be given access to de-identified data (your UB ID will be replaced by a random ID and the random ID will be stored for later access: this will ensure that your UB ID cannot be recovered from the de-identified data) and will be stored electronically indefinitely into the future. It will serve as the basis for scientific reports and publications.

If identifiers are removed from your identifiable private information or identifiable samples that are collected during this research, that information or those samples could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without your additional informed consent.

To incentivize participation, the instructor of your course will give the entire class some extra points on the next assignment/exam if at least 50% of the class participates. (Note that participating in the survey means submitting this form: you can submit this form in two ways---(i) by saying yes to the consent question and finishing up the rest of the survey, or (ii) by saying no to the consent question and submitting the form without finishing up the rest of the survey.) However, your instructor will only know if at least 50% of the class participated in the survey and will NOT receive any other information including the identities of students who participated in the survey or the exact percentage of class that participated in the survey.
